I am  a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at [the Aberdeen - South China Normal University Joint Institute](http://abdn.scnu.edu.cn/english/) in [the School of Computing and Natural Sciences](https://abdn.ac.uk/ncs/), [University of Aberdeen](https://abdn.ac.uk). I am also a visiting research fellow in the [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/digital-health/research/sphere/people/), [University of Bristol](https://bristol.ac.uk).

Prior to joining University of Aberdeen, I had been a research fellow in various universities:

* I worked with [Prof. Ian Craddock](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/digital-health/research/sphere/people/) and [Dr. Ryan McConville](https://ryanmcconville.com/) at University of Bristol developing machine learning models to identify potential digital biomarkers on a person living with Parkinson's disease with IoT and wearable devices. 
* I worked with [Prof. Sara Bernardini](https://www.sara-bernardini.com/) at Royal Holloway University of London to develop a multi-agent planning system for inspection, maintenance, or exploration in an extreme environment using various autonomous robots.
* I worked with [Prof. David Howey](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/david-howey/) at University of Oxford to develop probabilistic models for predicting battery health and its remaining useful life on real-world data.
* I received my PhD (2019) from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx), with [Prof. Jeremy Wyatt](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw) and [Prof. Nick Hawes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/), working on statistical machine learning for robot explorations as part of the [STRANDS project](http://strands.acin.tuwien.ac.at/).

My expertise is in mobile robotics, multimodal learning, data stream and time series analysis. I have applied my expertise to scientific and engineering problems in various fields ranging from service robotics, energy, healthcare, and robots in extreme environments. I am also interested in how new technologies, with machine learning engine, provide real-time efficient services while having to function in highly dynamic and resource-constrained environments.
