This site, as current as of {{ site.time | date: '%Y-%M-%d %H:%m' }}, was built using [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/), a theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), with inspirations from my PhD advisor [Prof. Nick Hawes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/) and my PhD examiner [Prof. Mike Osborne](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/).
