## Supervisions

I am currently involved in co-supervising Ph.D students at University of Bristol with [Dr. Ryan McConville](https://ryanmcconville.com/).

## Old Courses

During my time as a research fellow, I assisted lecturers to deliver some courses. Here are some of the courses I partially taught: 

* [Introduction to AI](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=EMAT31530) course in University of Bristol for spring term 2023. A third-year module that covers basic AI topics (search, machine learning, probabilistic AI)
* [AI Principles and Techniques](https://rl.talis.com/3/rhul/lists/7961B30E-B48D-6036-98DC-1C5364629DA1.html?lang=en) course in Royal Holloway University of London for academic year 2020 and 2021. A postgraduate module that covers intelligent agents, classical search, optimisation algorithms, and constraint satisfaction problems.
* [Advanced Topics in Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/courses/2019-2020/advml/) course in University of Oxford for academic year 2019. A postgraduate module that covers the advancement of deep learning with neural networks and probabilistic neural networks with applications on (and not limited to) natural language and image processing.

## Invited Talks

Here are some of the talks where I was invited as a guest lecturer in universities.
